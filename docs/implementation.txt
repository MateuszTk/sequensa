:COMPILED SEQUENSA HEADER
	<p>
		First 4 bytes of Sequensa header are always <code>0x73 0x71 0x63 0x00</code>, ASCII for "sqc\0". <br> 
		Next 3 bytes are respectively <code>MAJOR</code>, <code>MINOR</code>, and <code>PATCH</code> version components
		of the API used to compile the source file. <br> 
		Following is a single byte that determines the number of key-value pairs in the meta section of the header. <br>
		Each pair starts with a single byte designating the size of the key string, after which a standard unsigned integer is found, <br>
		it designates the length of the value string.
	</p> 
	<pre>0x01 0x03 0x41 0x42 0x43 0x03 0x44 0x45 0x46</pre>
	<p>
		This sample meta section contains a single pair (<code>0x01</code>) with a key of length 3 (<code>0x03</code>) that consists of <br>
		a string "ABC" (<code>0x41 0x42 0x43</code>) and a value of length 3 (<code>0x03</code> => head a=0x0 b=0x3 => nothing to load => 0 + 3 => 3) <br>
		that consists of a string "DEF" (<code>0x44 0x45 0x46</code>) <br>
		Those keys are guaranteed to be present in the header: (the implementation may choose to include more)

:COMPILED SEQUENSA BODY
	<p>
		It starts at the end of the header and ends at the end of the file, it is made of Sequensa Stream Bytecode (SSBC) tokens. <br>
		Each token starts with token header byte:
